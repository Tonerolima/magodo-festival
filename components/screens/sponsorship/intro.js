          ​A brand is the meaning behind your company's name, it goes beyond the
          symbols or the logo. It is what triggers a sense of recognition in the
          mind of a potential customer. How widely recognized the brand is,
          plays a major role in this. Brand awareness is the difference between
          the biggest companies and the rest because a brand widely known in the
          market has brand recognition and attracts positive remarks from
          customers which further strengthens the company's stand among
          competitors.
